In the next few sections we will create Multisig wallets for Bitcoin,
Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. We will also deploy a Multisig Contract for
Ethereum and setup a Multisign Account for XRP.

**Only one signatory needs to deploy the Ethereum Contract and setup the XRP
Account.** You should agree with the other signatories who will be responsible
for deploying the contract and setting up the XRP account.

Also of note: setting up Ethereum and XRP will require a small amount of funds.
The other coins can be setup without any funds.

Before proceeding, every other signatory (N-1 of them) must have sent you their
gpg-encrypted <span class="warning">Signatory Information Packets</span> so you will
have a total of **N** packets (your own included). Make sure you print every
<span class="warning">Signatory Information Packet</span>.
