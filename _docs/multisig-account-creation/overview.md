Before proceeding, every signatory (N of them) must have sent you their
gpg-encrypted <span class="warning">Signatory Information Packets</span>.

In the next few sections we will create Multisig wallets for Bitcoin,
Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. We will also deploy a Multisig Contract for
Ethereum and setup a Multisign Account for XRP.

Only one signatory needs to deploy the Ethereum Contract and setup the XRP
Account. However, each signatory will need to follow this protocol.

Also of note: setting up Ethereum and XRP will require a small amount of funds.
The other coins can be setup without and funds.
