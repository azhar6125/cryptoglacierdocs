description: Learn how to test withdrawing funds from CryptoGlacier,
  the step-by-step, secure, multi-blockchain, multi-signature,
  cold storage protocol for long-term storage of crypto assets
  based on the popular Glacier Protocol

It's important to make sure everything is working properly before proceeding.
You'll verify this by making a token deposit to, and withdrawal from, your cold
storage address on each of the protocols.

Depositing funds requires the Internet, and does not require
handling any critically sensitive cold storage data, so you can use any
Internet-connected computer for this section.

1. Open your electronic copy of the
<span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packet</span>.
2. Perform a test deposit.
    1. Use the wallet software or service of your choice to send a small
    transaction to your <span class="warning">bitcoin cold storage address</span>.
        1. Scan your <span class="warning">bitcoin cold storage address QR Code</span>
        from the <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packet</span>
        into the wallet software.
    2. Wait for the Bitcoin network to confirm the transaction at least once.
    The way you tell whether a transaction has been confirmed varies depending
    on the software or service you are using to send funds, but it should be
    displayed prominently.
3. Perform a test withdrawal.
    1. Execute the [Withdrawal Protocol](../withdrawal/execution.md) to withdraw
    the remaining balance from cold storage to a regular Bitcoin address of
    your choice.
    2. Wait for the Bitcoin network to confirm the transaction at least once.
    (Instructions for doing this are in the Withdrawal protocol.)
4. Repeat the above for Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether and XRP
