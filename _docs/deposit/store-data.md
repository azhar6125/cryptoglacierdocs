1. Shut down any nearby computers or smartphones, or other devices with cameras.
2. Immediate storage of
<span class="danger">Cold Storage Information Packets</span>
    1. Double-check to make sure each envelope contains a handwritten
    <span class="danger">24-word BIP39 Mnemonic</span> and a <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span>.
    2. Seal each envelope.
    3. Use tamper-resistant seals in addition to the envelope's normal adhesive
    to seal it.
    4. **Immediately** put all
    <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packets</span> in the safest
    possible location in your home or office that is immediately accessible.
    5. No, really. Like right now. That's basically a huge pile of cash you
    have just sitting there in envelopes on your desk.
3. Hardware storage
    1. Put tamper-resistant seals on the ends of all USB drives.
    2. Close the quarantined laptops, and seal the screen shut with a
    tamper-resistant seal.
    3. Store the hardware somewhere where it is unlikely to be used by accident.
4. Maintenance planning
  1. Create a reminder for yourself in six months to execute the
  [Maintenance Protocol](../check-balance/maintenance.md) .
  (If you don't have a reminder system you trust, find one on the web.)
5. Long-term storage of
<span class="danger">Cold Storage Information Packets</span>
    1. As soon as possible, transfer each
    <span class="danger">Cold Storage Information Packet</span> to its secure
    storage location (e.g. safe deposit box).
    2. Don't put more than one <span class="danger">packet</span> in long-term
    storage in the same building!
    Signatories should make sure that their respective keys are never stored in
    the same building, in the same city, or in the same institution. Doing so
    increases the risk of losing access to your funds in a disaster (e.g. fire)
    or thorough a thief/social attack.
    3. Remember the following
        1. Do **not** send your <span class="danger">packets</span>
        electronically -- no e-mail, no photograph, no "secure instant
        message".
        2. Do **not** keep any related notes *on* or *with* the
        <span class="danger">packets</span>.
        In the event the key is seen by someone untrustworthy or stolen by a
        random thief, such clues help them understand the significance of the
        key and give them an incentive to plot further thefts or attacks.

You have finished securing your cold storage funds.
