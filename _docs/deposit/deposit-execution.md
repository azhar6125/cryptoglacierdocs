  cold storage protocol for long-term storage of crypto assets

Depositing funds requires the Internet, and does not require handling any
critically sensitive cold storage data, so you can use any Internet-connected
computer for this section.

You will need access to an electronic *and* paper copy of your
<span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packet</span>.

1. If you are depositing a large amount, consider making a small deposit as a test followed by a second deposit for the remainder.
2. Verify cold storage address.
    1. Get one of the paper
    <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packets</span> containing
    your cold storage address.
    2. Open your electronic copy of the
    <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packet</span>.
    If you've lost access to it, you'll need to recreate a new electronic
    copy by transcribing one of the hardcopies (attached to each public key)
    by hand.
    3. **<span style="color: red;">Visually verify that the
    <span class="warning">cold storage addresses</span> are identical in the
    electronic copy and paper copy.</span>**
    This is to insure that the electronic copy was not damaged, hacked,
    accidentally changed due to a typo, etc.
    4. Return the paper
    <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packet</span> to its
    normal secure storage.
    5. Confirm this deposit address with your signatories.
3. Perform the deposit.
    1. Use the wallet software or service of your choice to **prepare** to send the
    desired amount of funds to your
    <span class="warning">cold storage address</span>.
    Crypto networks require a fee to process transactions. We recommend
    you use a wallet service that either covers the fees for you or recommends
    a fee amount automatically, which most do.

        **Enter all necessary transaction information, but do not actually execute the transaction.**

        1. Copy-paste your <span class="warning">cold storage address</span>
        from the <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packet</span>
        into the wallet software. You may also choose to scan the <span class="warning">Cold storage address QR Code</span>

    2. **Double-check that the address you pasted or scanned matches the address
    in the <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packet</span> and that
    confirmed by the other signatories. <span style="color: red;">If you use the
    wrong address, you will lose all of your funds with no recourse.</span>**
    3. Execute the transaction.
4. Verify the deposit on the public blockchain.
    1. Go to a block explorer, paste the address into the search bar, and press Enter.
    You'll be taken to a page that shows your <span class="warning">cold storage address</span>
    listed.
    2. Within a couple of minutes (and often much faster), you should be able
    to refresh this page and see your funds listed.
    3. Periodically refresh the page until you see the funds moved from
    "Unconfirmed" to be reflected in "Balance". This generally happens within
    15 minutes; if the network is unusually congested, it may take longer.

Your funds are now secured in cold storage.

If this was your first deposit to this <span class="warning">cold storage
address</span>, proceed to the next section. Otherwise, you have completed the
Deposit Protocol.
