The Withdrawal Protocol is used to transfer funds out of high-security
cold storage.

In this first section, we'll gather physical hardcopies of all information
needed to do the withdrawal. This is done with the help of a regular networked
computer to find some of this information online and translate it into printed
QR codes.

On any Internet-connected computer:

1. If this is **not** your first time working with CryptoGlacier:
    1. Use a networked computer to access the latest full release of CryptoGlacier (
    not just the protocol document) at <https://github.com/vogelito/CryptoGlacierProtocol/releases>.
    2. Open the protocol document (CryptoGlacier.pdf) within the ZIP file.
    3. Check the Release Notes (Appendix E) of the protocol document to see if
    there are any new versions of CryptoGlacier recommended.
    4. Whether or not you decide to upgrade, review the errata for the version
    of Glacier you are using at <https://github.com/vogelito/CryptoGlacierProtocol/releases>.
2. Open your electronic copy of the
<span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packet</span>.
